# Planeturem
Planeturem is a game I wrote in C++ during a gap year. It is a building/crafting game that allows the player to travel between planets, as well as non-planet locations, such as a space station. It is also on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3323260/Planeturem/).

It features:
 - Procedurally generated planets
 - Data-driven design for game data (game items, objects, entities, planet generation parameters etc)
 -
